description: First-time toolkit setup - cloud GPU, file transfer, voice, and prerequisites
---

# Setup

Interactive setup wizard for new users. Checks prerequisites, guides cloud GPU and storage configuration, deploys AI tools, and verifies everything works. Idempotent — safe to run again to add features or verify configuration.

## Key Principles

- **Progressive disclosure** — one phase at a time, explain before asking
- **Cost transparency** — always state what's free and what costs money before any action
- **Idempotent** — check what's already configured, skip completed steps
- **Test after each step** — don't just save keys, verify they work
- **Skippable** — every phase can be skipped, user can return later
- **Claude Code native** — use bash tools to check, configure, and verify. This IS the setup wizard.

## Entry Point

On invocation, assess current state and adapt:

### Step 0: Workspace check (configure the brand repo, not the core)

Everything this wizard writes — `.env`, cloud endpoints — belongs to a **brand repo**, never to the
toolkit core. Use the brand repo's Python (`.venv/bin/python`, created by `npx … init`; fall back to
`python3` in the core or an activated venv). Resolve the workspace first:

```bash
PY="$([ -x .venv/bin/python ] && echo .venv/bin/python || echo python3)"
"$PY" - <<'EOF'
import json, sys
from video_toolkit.paths import workspace_root, WorkspaceNotFound
try:
    ws = workspace_root()
except WorkspaceNotFound:
    print("NO_WORKSPACE"); sys.exit(0)
kind = json.loads((ws / "workspace.json").read_text()).get("kind", "")
print(f"{kind}\t{ws}")
EOF
```

- `brand<TAB><path>` → you're in a brand repo. Proceed to Step 1.
- `core<TAB><path>` or `NO_WORKSPACE` → **stop; do not configure the current directory.** Tell the user:

  > Setup configures a *brand repo* — its `.env` and cloud endpoints live there, not in the core.
  > Create one and run setup inside it:
  >
  >     npx github:xaralis/video-toolkit init my-brand-videos
  >     cd my-brand-videos
  >     claude          # then run /toolkit:setup here
  >
  > (Or `cd` into an existing brand repo and re-run /toolkit:setup.)

---

### Step 1: Detect Current State

Resolve both roots up front and use them for every path below. In the core repo they are the same
directory, so single-repo setup is unchanged:

```bash
PY="$([ -x .venv/bin/python ] && echo .venv/bin/python || echo python3)"
TOOLKIT="$("$PY" -c 'from video_toolkit.paths import toolkit_root; print(toolkit_root())')"
WS="$("$PY" -c 'from video_toolkit.paths import workspace_root; print(workspace_root())')"
```

- Toolkit assets (Docker apps, requirements) live under `$TOOLKIT`.
- All `.env` reads and writes target `$WS/.env`.

```
1. Check .env exists — if not, create from .env.example
2. Read current .env values (which keys are set vs placeholder)
3. Check prerequisites: node --version, python3 --version, ffmpeg -version
4. Check pip packages: python3 -c "import dotenv; import requests"
5. Check Modal CLI: modal --version (if installed)
6. Check for existing Modal apps: modal app list (if authenticated)
7. Summarize what's ready vs what needs setup
```

### Step 2: Present Current State

Show a clear status overview before asking anything:

```
Toolkit Setup

Prerequisites:
  [check] Node.js 20.x
  [check] Python 3.14
  [check] FFmpeg 7.1
  [check] pip packages installed

Cloud GPU:      Not configured
File transfer:  Not configured (using free fallback services)
Voice:          Not configured
ElevenLabs:     Not configured (optional, paid)

Let's get you set up! We'll go through each feature one at a time.
You can skip any step and come back later with /toolkit:setup.
```

**If everything is already configured**, show status and offer to verify/test:

```
Toolkit Setup — All Configured

Cloud GPU:      Modal (7 tools deployed)
File transfer:  Cloudflare R2 (bucket: video-toolkit)
Voice:          Qwen3-TTS (speaker: Ryan)
ElevenLabs:     Configured

Everything looks good! Want me to run a quick verification test?
```

---

## Phase 1: Prerequisites

Check and report. Don't install anything automatically — just tell the user what's needed and how to get it.

### Required

- **Node.js 18+**: `node --version`. If missing: "Install from https://nodejs.org/ — needed to render videos"
- **Claude Code**: Already running if they're seeing this command

### Recommended

- **Python 3.13+**: `python3 --version`. If missing: "Install from https://python.org/ — needed for AI voiceover, image editing, and all cloud GPU tools"
- **pip packages**: `"$WS/.venv/bin/python" -c "import dotenv; import requests"`. If missing: the toolkit is normally installed by `npx … init` into `.venv`; (re)install with `"$WS/.venv/bin/pip" install -e "$TOOLKIT"`.
- **FFmpeg**: `ffmpeg -version`. If missing: "Install with `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS) or see https://ffmpeg.org/ — needed for media conversion"

### Output

```
Prerequisites: 4/4 ready

Moving on to cloud GPU setup...
```

If anything critical is missing, explain what features require it and ask if user wants to continue or fix first.

---

## Phase 2: Cloud GPU Provider

This is the biggest unlock. Frame it properly.

### Explanation (deliver conversationally, not as a wall of text)

Explain what cloud GPU enables:
- AI voiceovers (Qwen3-TTS) — free, self-hosted text-to-speech
- AI image generation (FLUX.2) — title backgrounds, thumbnails
- AI image editing (Qwen-Edit) — transform photos, add effects
- AI upscaling (RealESRGAN) — enhance image quality
- AI music generation (ACE-Step) — background music, jingles
- Watermark removal (ProPainter) — clean up stock footage

Then present the choice:

### Option A: Modal (Recommended)

Frame the pitch:
- **$30/month free compute** on the Starter plan — just requires adding a payment method
- All 7 toolkit tools typically cost $0.50-2.00/month with normal use
- Faster cold starts than RunPod
- Scale to zero — no charges when idle
- Simple deployment: `modal deploy docker/modal-xxx/app.py`

Setup flow:
```
1. pip install modal
2. python3 -m modal setup
   → Opens browser for authentication
   → Creates ~/.modal.toml with credentials
3. Verify: modal app list
```

### Option B: RunPod

Frame honestly:
- Pay-as-you-go, typically $0.44/hr for GPU time
- Each job usually costs $0.01-0.50 depending on the tool
- More GPU variety available
- `--setup` flag automates endpoint creation
- **Availability can be spotty** — GPUs may not be available in some regions

Setup flow:
```
1. Create account at https://runpod.io/
2. Get API key from https://runpod.io/console/user/settings
3. Add to .env: RUNPOD_API_KEY=your_key_here
4. Each tool has --setup to create its endpoint automatically
```

### Option C: Both

Explain dual-provider benefits:
- Switch between providers with `--cloud modal` or `--cloud runpod`
- If one provider is down, use the other
- Modal for daily use (free tier), RunPod as fallback

### Option D: Skip

"No problem — you can still create and render videos with just Node.js. Run /toolkit:setup anytime to add cloud features later."

---

## Phase 3: Cloudflare R2 (File Transfer)

**Only show this phase if user chose a cloud GPU provider.**

### Explanation

"When you run a cloud GPU tool (like generating a voiceover or editing an image), the tool needs to send your file to the remote GPU and get the result back. Cloudflare R2 is the bridge.

**R2 is free** — 10GB storage, 10 million operations/month, and zero egress fees. That's more than enough for this toolkit. Without R2, tools fall back to free file hosting services (litterbox, 0x0.st) which are slower and less reliable."

### Setup Flow

Guide the user step by step. They'll need to do some of this in their browser:

```
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/
   → Create a free account if you don't have one

2. In the sidebar, click "R2 Object Storage"
   → Click "Create bucket"
   → Name it: video-toolkit (or whatever you prefer)
   → Choose automatic region
   → Click "Create bucket"

3. Go to R2 > Overview > "Manage R2 API Tokens"
   → Click "Create API Token"
   → Name: "video-toolkit"
   → Permissions: "Object Read & Write"
   → Scope: Apply to specific bucket → select your bucket
   → Click "Create API Token"
   → COPY the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key (shown only once!)

4. Your Account ID is in the URL: dash.cloudflare.com/{account_id}/r2
   Or find it in the R2 overview sidebar
```

After user provides the values, write them to .env:
```
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=xxx
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx
R2_BUCKET_NAME=video-toolkit
```

### Verify

Test R2 connectivity:
```bash
"$WS/.venv/bin/python" -c "
from video_toolkit.file_transfer import upload_to_r2, delete_from_r2
import tempfile, os
# Create tiny test file
tmp = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.txt', delete=False)
tmp.write(b'R2 connectivity test')
tmp.close()
url, key = upload_to_r2(tmp.name, 'setup-test')
os.unlink(tmp.name)
if url:
    print(f'R2 working! Test upload succeeded.')
    delete_from_r2(key)  # Clean up
else:
    print('R2 upload failed — check credentials')
"
```

---

## Phase 4: Deploy Cloud GPU Tools

**Only show this phase if user chose a cloud GPU provider in Phase 2.**

### Tool Selection

Present all 7 tools with descriptions and let user choose:

```
Which AI tools would you like to set up?

  1. [recommended] Speech (Qwen3-TTS)
     Free AI voiceovers — 9 speakers, voice cloning, tone presets
     This is the most-used tool in the toolkit.

  2. [recommended] Images (FLUX.2 Klein)
     Generate title backgrounds, scene illustrations, thumbnails
     Fast: ~3s per image on warm GPU

  3. Image Editing (Qwen-Image-Edit)
     Transform photos — add/remove objects, change style, backgrounds
     Note: Large model, ~8 min cold start on first use

  4. Upscaling (RealESRGAN)
     Enhance image quality 2x or 4x with AI
     Fast: ~5s per image

  5. Music (ACE-Step 1.5)
     Generate background music, jingles, vocals
     8 scene presets: corporate, ambient, dramatic, tension, cta...

  6. Watermark Removal (ProPainter)
     Remove watermarks from video using AI inpainting

  a. All of the above (recommended)
  s. Skip for now
```

Recommend "all" — with Modal's free tier, there's no cost to having them deployed (they scale to zero).

### Modal Deployment Flow

For each selected tool, **deploy only if it isn't already on the account.** The image builds remotely
in Modal's cloud and is cached per account, so a second brand repo usually deploys nothing and just
records the existing endpoints.

```bash
# What's already deployed on this Modal account:
modal app list

# Deploy a tool only when its app is missing. Run from the toolkit root so the
# app.py build context resolves. Repeat per selected tool:
cd "$TOOLKIT" && modal deploy docker/modal-qwen3-tts/app.py
#   docker/modal-flux2/app.py
#   docker/modal-image-edit/app.py
#   docker/modal-upscale/app.py
#   docker/modal-music-gen/app.py
#   docker/modal-propainter/app.py
```

If a tool's `MODAL_<TOOL>_ENDPOINT_URL` is already set in `$WS/.env` (or its app appears in
`modal app list`), skip the deploy and keep the existing URL. Otherwise parse the `.modal.run` URL
from the deploy output and write it to `$WS/.env`.

After each deploy, Modal prints the endpoint URL. Parse it and save to .env:
```
MODAL_QWEN3_TTS_ENDPOINT_URL=https://username--video-toolkit-qwen3-tts-...modal.run
MODAL_FLUX2_ENDPOINT_URL=https://username--video-toolkit-flux2-...modal.run
```

**Important**: The deploy output contains the URL. Look for lines containing `.modal.run` in the output. The URL format is typically:
`https://{username}--{app-name}-{class}-{method}.modal.run`

### RunPod Deployment Flow

RunPod tools use **prebuilt images published to GHCR** (`ghcr.io/conalmullan/video-toolkit-*`) —
nothing builds locally. `--setup` reuses an existing template/endpoint if one is already registered
on the account and only creates a new one otherwise. Run per selected tool (from `$WS`, using the
workspace Python):

```bash
"$WS/.venv/bin/python" -m video_toolkit.qwen3_tts --setup
#   video_toolkit.flux2 --setup
#   video_toolkit.image_edit --setup
#   video_toolkit.upscale --setup
#   video_toolkit.music_gen --setup
#   video_toolkit.dewatermark --setup
```

Each `--setup` writes the endpoint ID to the workspace `.env` (`$WS/.env`), creating it only if
missing — so re-running in a second brand repo just re-registers/records the endpoint, it never
rebuilds an image.

### Smoke Test

After deployment, run a quick test for at least one tool to verify the pipeline works:

**If Qwen3-TTS was deployed (most common):**
```bash
python3 -m video_toolkit.qwen3_tts --text "Setup complete! Your video toolkit is ready." \
  --speaker Ryan --tone warm --output /tmp/setup-test.mp3 \
  --cloud modal
```

Check that it produces an audio file. If it does, the full pipeline (upload → cloud GPU → download) is working.

**If FLUX.2 was deployed:**
```bash
python3 -m video_toolkit.flux2 --prompt "A minimal geometric logo on dark background" \
  --output /tmp/setup-test.png --cloud modal
```

---

## Phase 5: Voice Setup

### Explanation

"For voiceovers in your videos, you have two options:

**Qwen3-TTS (recommended, free)**
Self-hosted on your cloud GPU. 9 built-in speakers, tone presets (warm, professional, excited...), and voice cloning. This is what most toolkit users use.

**ElevenLabs (optional, paid)**
Premium cloud TTS with a large voice library. Pay-per-character. Better for some specific voice styles, but Qwen3-TTS is comparable quality for most use cases."

### Qwen3-TTS Setup

If Qwen3-TTS was deployed in Phase 4, it's already ready. Just confirm the default speaker:

```
Qwen3-TTS is ready! Available speakers:
  Ryan, Aiden, Vivian, Luna, Aurora, Aria, Nova, Stella, Orion

Default speaker: Ryan (warm male voice)

You can change the speaker per-video or set a default in your brand's voice.json.
To preview voices: python3 -m video_toolkit.qwen3_tts --list-voices
```

### ElevenLabs Setup (Optional)

```
1. Sign up at https://elevenlabs.io/
2. Go to Profile → API Keys
3. Copy your API key
```

After user provides the key, write to .env:
```
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=xxx
```

Optionally set a default voice ID:
```
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=xxx
```

---

## Phase 6: Verify & Summary

### Run Final Checks

```python
# Check .env has the expected values
1. Read .env
2. For each configured service, verify connectivity:
   - R2: test upload/download
   - Modal: modal app list (check apps are deployed)
   - RunPod: check API key works
   - ElevenLabs: test API key
3. Report results
```

### Present Summary

```

```

---

## Re-run Behavior

When `/toolkit:setup` is run again on an already-configured toolkit:

1. Show current state (Phase 6 summary style)
2. Offer options:
   - "Verify everything works" → run smoke tests
   - "Add a new tool" → jump to Phase 4 tool selection
   - "Change cloud provider" → jump to Phase 2
   - "Set up ElevenLabs" → jump to Phase 5
   - "Everything looks good" → exit

---

## Writing to .env

When adding or updating values in `.env`:

1. Read the current .env file
2. For each new value:
   - If the key exists (even commented out), uncomment and update it
   - If the key doesn't exist, append it in the appropriate section
3. Never remove existing values
4. Preserve comments and formatting
5. Show the user what was written

Example approach:
```python
# Read .env, update/add the key, write back
lines = Path('.env').read_text().splitlines()
# ... find and update or append
```

---

## Error Handling

- If `modal deploy` fails: show the error, suggest checking `modal app logs`, offer to retry
- If R2 test fails: re-check credentials, common issue is wrong bucket name or region
- If RunPod setup fails: check API key, check account has billing enabled
- If any step fails, don't block subsequent steps — mark as failed and continue
- Always show what succeeded even if something failed

---

## Verification Script

Use `python3 -m video_toolkit.verify_setup` throughout and at the end of setup:

```bash
# Quick check (no cloud calls) — use at start to detect current state
python3 -m video_toolkit.verify_setup

# With smoke tests (makes cloud GPU calls, ~$0.01) — use at end to verify
python3 -m video_toolkit.verify_setup --test

# Machine-readable — use to programmatically check what's configured
python3 -m video_toolkit.verify_setup --json
```

Run `verify_setup.py --json` at the start of `/toolkit:setup` to detect current state and skip already-configured phases. Run it with `--test` at the end for the Phase 6 verification.

## Integration with Other Commands

- `/toolkit:video` should check for cloud GPU configuration and mention `/toolkit:setup` if not configured
- `/toolkit:generate-voiceover` should suggest `/toolkit:setup` if no TTS provider is configured
- `/toolkit:versions` could include a setup status check

---

## Evolution

### Local improvements (no upstream contribution needed)
- Add `--quick` flag to skip explanations and just deploy everything with defaults
- Add `--verify` flag to only run smoke tests on existing configuration
- Add `--reset` flag to clear all configuration and start fresh

### Upstream contribution candidates
- The command pattern itself could be useful for other Claude Code toolkits
- R2 setup flow is generic enough to extract as a reusable guide
