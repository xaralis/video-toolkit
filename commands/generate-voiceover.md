# Generate Voiceover

Help me generate a voiceover for a Remotion video project using ElevenLabs or Qwen3-TTS.

## Project Integration

Before gathering configuration, check if we're in a project context:

1. **Check for active project:**
   - Look for `project.json` in current directory or parent `projects/*/`
   - If found, read it to understand project state

2. **Check review status:**
   If project has `phase: "review"` or no `reviewStatus` on scenes:
   ```
   ⚠️  Scene review not complete.

   Generating voiceover before review risks:
   - Narration that doesn't match visuals
   - Timing mismatches
   - Wasted API credits if script needs changes

   Run `/toolkit:scene-review` first to verify each scene in Remotion Studio.

   Options:
   1. Run /toolkit:scene-review first (recommended)
   2. Generate voiceover anyway (not recommended)
   ```

   Only proceed if user explicitly chooses option 2.

3. **Check for per-scene scripts (preferred):**
   Look for `public/audio/scenes/*.txt` files in the project directory.

   If found:
   ```
   I see you're working on: {project.name}

   Found per-scene scripts in public/audio/scenes/ (recommended):
     - 01-title.txt (estimate: ~3s)
     - 02-overview.txt (estimate: ~15s)
     - 03-demo.txt (estimate: ~20s)
     - 04-summary.txt (estimate: ~12s)

   Total estimated: ~50 seconds of narration

   Options:
   1. Generate per-scene audio (recommended)
   2. Generate single voiceover file (legacy)
   ```

   Default to option 1 (per-scene) when scene scripts exist.

4. **If no scene scripts but VOICEOVER-SCRIPT.md exists:**
   ```
   I see you're working on: {project.name}

   Script: VOICEOVER-SCRIPT.md (ready)
   Audio status: ⬜ Not yet generated

   Options:
   1. Split into scene scripts first (recommended for iteration)
   2. Generate single voiceover file
   ```

5. **After generation completes:**
   - Update `project.json`:
     - Set `audio.voiceover.status: "present"`
     - If per-scene, set `audio.voiceover.mode: "per_scene"`
     - Transition `phase` if appropriate (review → audio → editing)
   - Add session entry
   - Regenerate project CLAUDE.md

## Your Tasks

1. **Detect Script Source**
   Look for scripts in this order:
   - Check for `public/audio/scenes/*.txt` files (per-scene mode)
   - Check if `VOICEOVER-SCRIPT.md` exists in the current working directory
   - Check if `VOICEOVER-SCRIPT.md` exists in parent directories (up to 3 levels)
   - If not found, ask the user to provide the script text or file path

2. **Gather Configuration**
   Use the AskUserQuestion tool to collect:

   **Question 1 - TTS Provider:**
   Options:
   - ElevenLabs (default) — high quality, paid API
   - Qwen3-TTS — self-hosted via RunPod, free/cheap, voice cloning

   If Qwen3-TTS is selected, check the project brand (from `project.json`) for a clone profile:
   1. Load `brands/{brand}/voice.json`
   2. If `qwen3.clone` exists and `refAudio` file is present:
      ```
      Clone profile detected for brand '{brand}':
        Reference: assets/voice-reference.m4a
        Transcript: "Welcome to this video walkthrough..."

        1. Use cloned voice (recommended)
        2. Use built-in speaker instead
      ```
   3. If no clone profile, offer built-in speakers as usual

   **Question 2 - Generation Mode (if scene scripts found):**
   Options:
   - Per-scene generation (recommended) — each .txt becomes a .mp3
   - Single voiceover file (legacy)

   **Question 3 - Voice Settings:**

   *If ElevenLabs selected:*
   Options:
   - Use defaults (stability: 0.85, similarity: 0.95)
   - Customize settings

   *If Qwen3-TTS selected with cloned voice:*
   Skip tone selection entirely. Show:
   ```
   Using cloned voice from brand '{brand}' — tone is determined by your reference recording.

   Tip: Want a different feel? Record a new reference clip and update
   `qwen3.clone.refAudio`/`refText` in `brands/{brand}/voice.json` (e.g.,
   warmer, more energetic). You can have multiple clone profiles across brands.
   ```

   *If Qwen3-TTS selected with built-in speaker (no clone):*
   - Speaker name (default: Ryan). Options: Ryan, Aiden (EN), Vivian, Serena (ZH), Ono_Anna (JA), Sohee (KO)
   - Voice tone (choose one):
     1. Neutral (no instruction)
     2. Warm — friendly, conversational
     3. Professional — clear, measured
     4. Excited — enthusiastic, energetic
     5. Calm — soothing, relaxed
     6. Serious — authoritative, gravitas
     7. Storyteller — captivating narrator
     8. Tutorial — patient, step-by-step
     9. Custom instruction (type your own)

   Note: Per-scene tone overrides are supported with built-in speakers. Add `[tone: excited]` or `[instruct: Whisper gently]` as the first line of any scene `.txt` file. These are ignored when using a cloned voice.

3. **Execute Voiceover Generation**

   **ElevenLabs — Per-scene mode (recommended):**
   ```bash
   cd REPO_ROOT/PROJECT_DIR
   python3 -m video_toolkit.voiceover \
     --scene-dir public/audio/scenes \
     --json
   ```

   **ElevenLabs — Single-file mode (legacy):**
   ```bash
   cd REPO_ROOT/PROJECT_DIR
   python3 -m video_toolkit.voiceover \
     --script "SCRIPT_PATH" \
     --output "public/audio/voiceover.mp3" \
     --json
   ```

   **Qwen3-TTS — Per-scene mode:**
   ```bash
   cd REPO_ROOT/PROJECT_DIR
   python3 -m video_toolkit.voiceover \
     --provider qwen3 \
     --speaker SPEAKER_NAME \
     --scene-dir public/audio/scenes \
     --json
   ```

   **Qwen3-TTS — With brand clone profile:**
   ```bash
   cd REPO_ROOT/PROJECT_DIR
   python3 -m video_toolkit.voiceover \
     --provider qwen3 \
     --brand BRAND_NAME \
     --scene-dir public/audio/scenes \
     --json
   ```

   **Qwen3-TTS — With tone preset:**
   ```bash
   cd REPO_ROOT/PROJECT_DIR
   python3 -m video_toolkit.voiceover \
     --provider qwen3 \
     --speaker Ryan \
     --tone warm \
     --scene-dir public/audio/scenes \
     --json
   ```

   **Qwen3-TTS — With custom instruction (overrides --tone):**
   ```bash
   cd REPO_ROOT/PROJECT_DIR
   python3 -m video_toolkit.voiceover \
     --provider qwen3 \
     --speaker Ryan \
     --instruct "Speak warmly and calmly" \
     --scene-dir public/audio/scenes \
     --json
   ```

   **Qwen3-TTS — Single-file mode:**
   ```bash
   cd REPO_ROOT/PROJECT_DIR
   python3 -m video_toolkit.voiceover \
     --provider qwen3 \
     --speaker Ryan \
     --script "SCRIPT_PATH" \
     --output "public/audio/voiceover.mp3" \
     --json
   ```

4. **Report Results**

   **Per-scene results:**
   ```
   Per-scene audio generated:
     ✅ 01-title.mp3 (3.2s)
     ✅ 02-overview.mp3 (15.4s)
     ✅ 03-demo.mp3 (20.1s)
     ✅ 04-summary.mp3 (11.8s)

   Total: 50.5s (1515 frames @ 30fps)
   Characters: 892

   Concatenated: public/audio/voiceover-concat.mp3 (50.5s)

   Next steps:
   1. Update sprint-config.ts with audioFile for each scene
   ```

   **Single-file results:**
   ```
   Voiceover generated:
     File: public/audio/voiceover.mp3
     Duration: 50.5s (1515 frames @ 30fps)
     Characters: 892

   For your config:
     audio: { voiceoverFile: 'voiceover.mp3' }
   ```

## Tool Location

- Voiceover tool: `python3 -m video_toolkit.voiceover` (invocable from any CWD once installed)
- Qwen3-TTS tool: `python3 -m video_toolkit.qwen3_tts`
- Config: `_internal/toolkit-registry.json` (voice ID)
- API Key: `.env` file (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` for ElevenLabs, `RUNPOD_API_KEY` + `RUNPOD_QWEN3_TTS_ENDPOINT_ID` for Qwen3)

## Voice Settings Reference

| Setting | Default | Range | Effect |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| stability | 0.85 | 0-1 | Higher = more consistent, lower = more expressive |
| similarity | 0.95 | 0-1 | Higher = closer to original voice |
| style | 0.0 | 0-1 | Higher = more stylistic variation |
| speed | 1.0 | 0.5-2.0 | Speech speed multiplier |

## Per-Scene Script Structure

When using per-scene mode, create `.txt` files in `public/audio/scenes/`:

```
public/audio/scenes/
├── 01-title.txt       → 01-title.mp3
├── 02-overview.txt    → 02-overview.mp3
├── 03-demo.txt        → 03-demo.mp3
├── 04-summary.txt     → 04-summary.mp3
└── 05-credits.txt     → 05-credits.mp3
```

Each file contains just the narration text for that scene. Benefits:
- Regenerate individual scenes without re-doing everything
- Scene durations match audio naturally (no offset calculations)
- Each `<Audio>` starts at frame 0 within its `Series.Sequence`

**To split an existing VOICEOVER-SCRIPT.md:**
1. Create the `public/audio/scenes/` directory
2. Copy each scene's narration to a numbered `.txt` file
3. Use naming like `01-title.txt`, `02-overview.txt` for sorted order

## Script Format Tips

Share these tips with the user:
- Use `<break time="1.0s" />` for pauses (SSML-style)
- Keep sentences short for natural pacing
- Test with `--dry-run` flag first to check character count
- The voice ID is configured in `_internal/toolkit-registry.json`

## Error Handling

**ElevenLabs:**
- If `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is missing, tell user to add it to `.env`
- If voice ID is missing, tell user to set `config.voiceId` in `toolkit-registry.json`

**Qwen3-TTS:**
- If `RUNPOD_API_KEY` is missing, tell user to add it to `.env`
- If `RUNPOD_QWEN3_TTS_ENDPOINT_ID` is missing, tell user to run `python3 -m video_toolkit.qwen3_tts --setup`

**Both:**
- If script file not found, offer to create a template
- If scene directory empty, prompt to create scene scripts first

## Example Output

**Per-scene mode:**
```
Per-scene audio generated:
  ✅ 01-title.mp3 (3.2s)
  ✅ 02-overview.mp3 (15.4s)
  ✅ 03-demo.mp3 (20.1s)
  ✅ 04-summary.mp3 (11.8s)

Total: 50.5s (1515 frames @ 30fps)
Characters: 892

Concatenated: public/audio/voiceover-concat.mp3 (50.5s)
```

**Single-file mode (legacy):**
```
